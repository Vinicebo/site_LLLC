            <p>The registration of computer programs in BRAZIL IS ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE INPI (National Institute of Industrial Property) established through Decree 2,556/1998. The ACT OF SOFTWARE REGISTRATION by the INPI is governed by the Copyright Law and the Software Law.
            </p>

            <p>The importance of software registration lies in the fact that it guarantees proof of who is the real owner of the right to exploit this Intellectual Property creation. Likewise, the registration proves the actual date of creation of the program, and who are the authors involved
            </p>

            <p>The registration will also allow the owner to prove and exercise his right against third parties. In this case, the owner will be able to take precautions and protect himself against - unauthorized copies and incorrect use by third parties, which generally characterizes Piracy and unfair competition involving software.</p>

            <p>Software registration covers both a graphic tool, such as an application, or data management software, such as a databank, all in their final version, and not just in the form of an idea or a concept of the program.</p>

            <p>We can technically and legally assist you in the protection and defense of your creation involving software and creations related to Artificial Intelligence.</p>
